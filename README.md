About the project:
In this application, there will be 3 main actors:
1. User/Authors - to post, comment and send votes.
2. Maintainers/Moderators - to maintain Users and Pages
3. Admin - to maintain moderators

Introduction and Objective:
The goal of this proposed project is to develop a social networking site like to Twitter or StackOverflow,
but with a focus on improving the user experience. Users will be able to connect with one another through the platform,
exchange ideas, and take part in conversations that are relevant to their interests.
The site will also include a robust search and tagging system that will allow users to quickly find and follow conversations on subjects that are important to them.
The platform will enact stringent moderation to detect and delete hazardous content to guarantee a secure and welcoming environment for all users.
Our platform, in our opinion, has the potential to be a useful tool for people and groups looking to connect and collaborate in meaningful ways.
Users can create profiles, follow other users, and share short messages or "tweets" related to specific topics or themes.
Moderators/Maintainers role is to check whether the content is meaningful or not, and check if users are authenticated.
The role of Admins is to add/delete moderators and maintain posts.
Finally, if time permits, Additionally, the platform will offer a chat application that allows users to communicate in real-time with other users,
either one-on-one or in groups, to exchange ideas, collaborate on projects, or simply network with like-minded individuals.

Use cases:

1. User:
- Can post
- Can update profile
- Can comment or can upvote/downvote
- Can request for a page,can be added to a specific Page
- Can initiate a topic
- can comment on a given topic
2. Moderator/Maintainer:
- Can create Pages
- Can Add/restrict user to their page
- Can create page for specific content
3. Admin:
- Can add/remove Moderator
For this application I'll be implementing it in SpringBoot, using MVC pattern with service and security.
For database connectivity, I'll be using Hibernate and MySQL having DAO pattern.
Finally, for front-end I'll use Javascript and JQuery functionalities.
